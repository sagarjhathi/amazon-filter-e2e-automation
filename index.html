cameras that capture life with new perspective.take advantage of this camera phone’s agile angles. quick shot lets you shoot a selfie right from the cover screen, even allowing a ratio change to show you the full frame before you shoot. or unfold and take position with flexcam holding up the camera so you can get a hands-free group shot or selfie at mind-blowing perspectives.
faster charging speed. longer battery life.an upgraded 4nm processor works with the long-lasting 3700mah (typical) battery to power through the hours. when it's low, plug in for super fast charging, or bypass the cord with fast wireless charging 2.0 with all that power to spare, you can even share a charge with your friend or your earbuds with wireless powershare.
see what's important in a glance with cover screen. the 4.82 cm (1.9-inch) cover screen now gives you even more information and control.
