 About: about this item
style and function that fits in your pocket. it's a pocket-sized statement piece. small but mighty when folded, this phone is compact enough to fit in your palm, but leaves a big impression with sleek, hazy colors that match your vibe.
our toughest samsung galaxy foldables ever. the world’s first water-resistant foldable smartphones have never been so strong. these scratch-defying devices are our toughest ever with exclusive corning gorilla glass victus2 on the outside and the super durable ultra thin glass on the inside. and the hinge is protected by armor aluminum — our toughest aluminum frame.
cameras that capture life with new perspective. take advantage of this camera phone’s agile angles. quick shot lets you shoot a selfie right from the cover screen, even allowing a ratio change to show you the full frame before you shoot. or unfold and take position with flexcam holding up the camera so you can get a hands-free group shot or selfie at mind-blowing perspectives.
faster charging speed. longer battery life. an upgraded 4nm processor works with the long-lasting 3700mah (typical) battery to power through the hours. when it's low, plug in for super fast charging, or bypass the cord with fast wireless charging 2.0 with all that power to spare, you can even share a charge with your friend or your earbuds with wireless powershare.

style and function that fits in your pocket. it's a pocket-sized statement piece. small but mighty when folded, this phone is compact enough to fit in your palm, but leaves a big impression with sleek, hazy colors that match your vibe.
our toughest samsung galaxy foldables ever. the world’s first water-resistant foldable smartphones have never been so strong. these scratch-defying devices are our toughest ever with exclusive corning gorilla glass victus2 on the outside and the super durable ultra thin glass on the inside. and the hinge is protected by armor aluminum — our toughest aluminum frame.
cameras that capture life with new perspective. take advantage of this camera phone’s agile angles. quick shot lets you shoot a selfie right from the cover screen, even allowing a ratio change to show you the full frame before you shoot. or unfold and take position with flexcam holding up the camera so you can get a hands-free group shot or selfie at mind-blowing perspectives.
faster charging speed. longer battery life. an upgraded 4nm processor works with the long-lasting 3700mah (typical) battery to power through the hours. when it's low, plug in for super fast charging, or bypass the cord with fast wireless charging 2.0 with all that power to spare, you can even share a charge with your friend or your earbuds with wireless powershare.
